Yeah, that's about it. I'm making these half with the intention of being used for a friends game, and half to be used in an upcoming minecraft texture pack, but I'll be releasing all the textures I make for it here as I finish them, licensed under MIT, so feel free to use them for whatever projects you like

( Though, I'd love to hear about it! )
